# star_wars_api

# This is meant to be a website.

## To run it, download the entirety in the current file order, type pwd to see the path, put file at the front, and open it in a browser.  It's like a normal webpage from there.

### The basics are that it interacts with the Star Wars API as a user interface.  All credit goes to http://swapi.co/ and creator Paul Hallett.  I merely played with a front end for it.

### I used HTML, CSS, JS, AJAX, Bootstrap, custom Bootstrap buttons, an open source version of the Star Wars font, a font kit generator courtesy of FontSquirrel...it was a lot of learning and I'm proud of it even though it has quite a ways to go.
